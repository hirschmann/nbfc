NBFC is a cross-platform fan control service for notebooks.
It comes with a powerful configuration system, which allows to adjust it to many different notebook models.

## Intel 10th gen / AMD 5000 and up
Compatability with current gen Intel and AMD CPUs (10th gen and up, 5000 and up) has a workaround [here](https://github.com/UraniumDonut/nbfc-revive/issues/27).
